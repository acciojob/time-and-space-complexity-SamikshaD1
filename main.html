    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>When analyzing algorithms, one crucial aspect to consider is their <strong>time complexity</strong>. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An algorithm with better time complexity is more <em>efficient</em>, as it completes its task faster, making it preferable for large datasets.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Space complexity</strong> is another essential factor. It represents the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. Algorithms with lower space complexity are generally preferred, as they use less memory. Space complexity is often denoted using big O notation, like <strong>O(n)</strong>, where 'n' is the input size. This notation signifies the upper bound on memory usage as the input size increases.</p>

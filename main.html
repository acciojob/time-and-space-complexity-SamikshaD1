	 <h1>Exploring Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>When analyzing algorithms, a critical aspect to consider is time complexity.it evaluates the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute, particularly efficient as the size of the input increases. An algorithm with a lower is more as it can complete its task in a shorter amount of time, making it suitable for scenarios where execution speed matters.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Space complexity</em></strong>, on the other hand, deals with the memory requirements of an algorithm. It assesses how much memory an algorithm needs to execute as the input size grows. In the context of the notation <strong>O(n)</strong> is commonly used, where 'n' represents the input size. Notably, the algorithm is indicative of how well it manages memory resources. It's worth emphasizing that algorithms can achieve a balance between space complexity by employing suitable techniques and data structures.</p>
